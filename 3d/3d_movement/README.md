# 3D Movement

**Goal:** Experiment with smooth 3D movement and bounded play space.

## Controls
- WASD: move

## Concepts Practiced
- Input smoothing and acceleration limits
- Bounded area with velocity bounce
- Simple CharacterBody3D-style motion

## Future Ideas
- Add camera follow and orbit controls
- Add jump and gravity
- Add friction presets for different surfaces
