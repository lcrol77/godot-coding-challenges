# Catlike Coding 2D Clock

**Goal:** Recreate a 2D clock with animated hands and spawn randomized, physics-driven clocks.

## Controls
- None

## Concepts Practiced
- Time-based hand rotation (seconds/minutes/hours)
- RigidBody2D spawning with randomized scale and time offsets
- Custom shader-driven clock face coloring

## Future Ideas
- Add UI to switch start-time modes and time scales
- Add cleanup effects when clocks hit the bottom
- Add pause and slow-motion controls
