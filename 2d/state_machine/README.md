# State Machine

**Goal:** Implement a simple AI state machine (idle and wander) with a basic player controller.

## Controls
- Uses default `ui_left`, `ui_right`, `ui_up`, `ui_down` actions

## Concepts Practiced
- Finite state machine pattern
- State transitions and decoupled behaviors
- Player movement with CharacterBody2D

## Future Ideas
- Add chase/attack states
- Add state debugging UI
- Add sensing and line-of-sight checks
