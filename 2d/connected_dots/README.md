# Connected Dots

**Goal:** Simulate moving dots that connect with lines based on proximity.

## Controls
- None

## Concepts Practiced
- Distance-based connections with dynamic line drawing
- Bouncing motion using CharacterBody2D
- Area2D proximity detection

## Future Ideas
- Add mouse attraction/repulsion
- Vary line thickness and color by distance
- Add wraparound edges or screen bounds
