# Platformer Movement

**Goal:** Build a 2D platformer controller with acceleration, coyote time, and jump buffering.

## Controls
- A/D or Left/Right: move
- Space: jump

## Concepts Practiced
- Acceleration, friction, and air resistance
- Coyote time and jump buffering
- Basic animation state switching

## Future Ideas
- Add dash and wall-jump mechanics
- Support slopes and moving platforms
- Add variable jump height tuning
